## Brieft about APIs used
1. I have used all three APIs to visualize the data.
2. For this api - Worldwide data of cases: https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/all. I have used line char to show the data.
3. Country Specific data of cases: https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/countries - For this API I have used react leaflet for showing data on the map with markers and popup
4. Graph data for cases with date: https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/historical/all?lastdays=all - Again, I have decided to use the line graph to show the trend between the two data's.
